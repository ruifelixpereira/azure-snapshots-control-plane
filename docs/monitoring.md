# Snapshots Monitoring

## Overview

Monitoring is a critical aspect of managing Azure Disk Snapshots. It helps ensure that snapshot operations are completed successfully and provides insights into the health and performance of the backup process.

## Key Metrics

When monitoring snapshots, consider the following key metrics:

- **Snapshot Creation Time**: Measure the time taken to create snapshots. This helps identify any performance bottlenecks.
- **Snapshot Copy Status**: Monitor the status of snapshot copies to the secondary region. Ensure that copies are completed successfully.
- **Error Rates**: Track any errors that occur during snapshot creation or copying. This helps in proactive issue resolution.

## Monitoring Tools

Azure provides several tools for monitoring snapshots:

- **Azure Monitor**: Use Azure Monitor to set up alerts and dashboards for snapshot-related metrics.
- **Log Analytics**: Leverage Log Analytics to query and analyze snapshot logs for deeper insights.

## Best Practices

- Set up alerts for critical snapshot metrics to ensure timely responses to issues.
- Regularly review snapshot logs to identify trends and potential problems.
- Use the Azure Monitor workbook for a consolidated view of snapshot operations.
